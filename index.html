				<p>Daniel was a dream interpreter in Babylonian times. Through this God given ability, he became the second most powerful person after the King, and caused the Babylonian empire to prosper under his stewardship.</p>
				<p>Dibraw is the hebrew word for cause, reason, intent. A three fold reason. For the reason that Daniel was placed at the right place and at the right time to interpret the King's dream and caused him to prosper beyond his imagination. For the reason that the Holy Spirit inspired this site and not mere man. And for the reason that all the honour and glory is to go to Him and Him alone.</p>
				<p>May this site inspire  -  not by my own but by the power of the Holy Spirit and the one true King Jesus, who inspire the dreams and ideas that is to come.</p>
