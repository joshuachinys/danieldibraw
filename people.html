				<p>When I accepted Christ as my Lord and Savior 12 years ago, I was 30 years of age. It was a significant turning point in my life. Other than reading the bible, I didn't know much about what it means to be a believer and follower of Jesus Christ, neither am I familiar with the vocabulary that was frequently used in the Christian community. I began my search for men and women of God who have gone before me, who can strengthen my walk with our Lord.</p>
				<p>I chanced upon the term "Apologetics" and (you would have expected) also Ravi's story and his teachings on this amazing topic of defending the Christian faith. Ever since God saved him from his suicide attempt during his teenage years, he had promised to "leave no stone unturned" in his pursuit of defending the Christian faith. He had truly lived out his promise to this day.</p>
				<p>My first encounter with his message was one where he expounded on what it means to have a coherent worldview - Origin, Meaning, Morality and Destiny - and how Jesus was the only coherent answer amongst all other worldviews. He had explained it so clearly and articulately that any counter argument would likely be deemed a ridicule.</p>

				<p>"Apologetics in the 21st century" - a recent sermon preached in Saddleback Church. Humourous and thought provoking.</p>
